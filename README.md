=====

This plugin provides some javascript and css files that are used by other
plugins:

- a popup calendar
- a slimbox implementation that allows paging between images without a
    slideshow
- image resizing and url creation
- an updated database backup

These scripts, especially the calendar, may not work correctly if they are
loaded more than once, so this plugin becomes the single source for them.

Also provided are some common functions used across plugins.
